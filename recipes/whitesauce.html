<p>Every home cook needs a good béchamel in their repertoire – our step-by-step guide to this pasta sauce will teach you how to make a roux and keep your sauce lump-free</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>500ml whole milk</li>
        <li>1 onion halved</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>2 cloves</li>
        <li>50g butter</li>
        <li>50g plain flour</li>
    </ul>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<h4>Method</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the milk to the boil in a small saucepan with the onion, bay leaf and cloves.  Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 20 minutes</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>Melt the butter in another saucepan, then add the plain flour.  Stir continuously until a paste forms - this is called a roux.  Continue cooking for 2 minutes.</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>Remove the onion, bay, and cloves from the milk and discard.  Add the now infused milk to the roux gradually, strirring as you go, until you get a smooth sauce.  Cook for 5-10 minutes, stirring continuously, until the sauce has thickened.  Season to taste.</li>
    </ol>
