    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagne.jpg">
    <h4>Prepare this easy homemade lasagne ahead of time and save in the freezer, uncooked, for when you need it during a busy week.</h4>
    <p>I don't have anything further to say about lasagne.  This project has asked for content related to the dish to go here.
        Lasagne is pretty tasty I guess.  Do you like the picture I put above?  Looks tasty.

    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the meat sauce, heat 2tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about ten minutes until browned all over</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>Finely chop 4 slices of proscuitto then stir through the meat mixture</li>
        </p> 
        <p>  
            <li>Pour over 800g passata and 200ml hot beef stock.  Add a little grated nutmeg, then season</li>
        </p>
        <p>   
            <li>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 minutes until the sauce looks rich</li>
        </p> 
        <p>  
            <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160F/Gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish</li>
        </p>
        <p>   
            <li>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack.
                Drizzle over roughly 130g <a href="whitesauce.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">white sauce </a></li>
        </p>
        <p>    
            <li>Repeat until you have three layers of pasta.  Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you can't see any pasta poking through.</li>
        </p>
        <p>  
            <li>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top</li>
        </p>
        <p></p>   
            <li>Arrange the rest of the proscuitto on top.  Bake for 45 miutes until the top is bubbling and lightly browned</li>
